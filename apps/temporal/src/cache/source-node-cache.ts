/**
 * Phase 4 — Source-node ctx-merge cache writer (US-133 Scenario 3).
 *
 * Source nodes are the workflow's edge to the outside world (Phase 8).
 * They have no `inputs[]` and therefore can't be hashed via the
 * standard `computeInputHash` (which sha256s `sha256(stableJson({}))`
 * — the same hash for every source node, which would conflate
 * unrelated inbound payloads).
 *
 * Per REQUIREMENTS.md L16, a source node's cache row is keyed by:
 *   - `configHash = sha256(stableJson(sourceNode.parameters ?? {}))`
 *   - `inputHash  = sha256(stableJson(initialCtx))`   — the inbound payload
 *   - `outputCtx  = initialCtx`                       — the source's "output"
 *   - `outputKind = sourceCatalogEntry.outputKind`    — resolved via SOURCE_CATALOG
 *
 * The `inputHash` of every downstream activity then naturally
 * incorporates the source's contribution (via the standard
 * `computeInputHash` reading the ctx values the source merged in).
 * That's how source nodes "participate in the same hash chain"
 * (TRY_IN_PLACE_DESIGN.md §2.3).
 *
 * This helper is invoked from `graph-workflow.ts` once at workflow start
 * for each `SourceNode` in the graph. It is intentionally separate from
 * `executeCachedActivity` (which expects a `rawExecute` to run) because
 * the source's ctx-merge already happened before this function runs —
 * there's nothing to execute, only a cache row to persist.
